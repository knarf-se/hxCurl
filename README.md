hxCurl
======

This is a simple wrapper for between HaXe and the wounderful libcurl.

Please not that this project is in its infancy, many features are not
implemented yet, most notable the feature of documentation.

⁂

If you want to get an API reference, type the following on the terminal (as root):
$ `haxelib install chxdoc`  
$ `haxelib run chxdoc install`  
$ `./build doc`  

And the API documentation will be generated and placed in
`hxCurl/docs/reference/index.html`.

Check the tests/Test.hx file for some very simple examples.

Patches are **always** welcome.

Usage
-----
type $ `./build` in the terminal to build the project

Requirements
------------
hxCurl requires libcurl for operation and developement files to compile.
