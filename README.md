hxCurl
======

This is a simple wrapper for between HaXe and the wounderful libcurl.

Please not that this project is in its infancy, many features are not
implemented yet, most notable the feature of documentation. But it is still
quite useable for simpler and tasks (get / send data).

Check the tests/Test.hx file for some very simple examples.

Patches are **always** welcome.
