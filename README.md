hxCurl
======

This is a simple wrapper for between HaXe and the wounderful libcurl.

Please not that this project is in its infancy, many features are not
implemented yet, most notable the feature of documentation.

					⁂

Check the tests/Test.hx file for some very simple examples.

Patches are **always** welcome.

Usage
-----
type $ `./build` in the terminal to build the project

Requirements
------------
hxCurl requires libcurl for operation and developement files to compile.
